# Movies Search for Fast

## What were the most difficult tasks?

- To be completely honest none of the tasks themselves were difficult. I decided to use some technologies that I haven't used, like recoil, so adding new tech was probably the most difficult part of building out this app.

## Did you learn anything new while completing the assignment?

- Yes. I decided to learn a new state management tool (recoil). I really enjoyed using it and it seems to fit in really nicely with hooks.

## What did you not have time to add? What work took the up majority of your time?

- I really would have liked to add pagination. I think that would have made the overall search more useful.
- I also would have liked to add tests for my work.
- My time was pretty evenly split between wiring up functionality and styling. I used some technologies that I haven't used for a while so I also had to spend some time reading documentation.

## How could the application be improved?

- A more robust search could make the application a lot better. Maybe something like the search in the documentation for the movies api.
- A more robust playlist feature would also really improve the application.
